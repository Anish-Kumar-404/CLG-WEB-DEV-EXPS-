    <h1>Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G</h1>

    <p>This is a detailed review of the Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G.</p>
    <p>
      Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G has launched in India with a relatively-expensive
      price tag. The Redmi Note 11 Pro+ 5G successor finds itself in the Xiaomi
      11i HyperCharge price category, courtesy of the upgrades on offer. The
      phone comes with a glass back and a 120Hz AMOLED display. The 6.67-inch
      screen is flat and has a hole-punch cutout. Its headlining feature is the
      200-megapixel primary camera. The triple-camera setup also features an
      8-megapixel ultra-wide camera and a 2-megapixel macro camera.For selfies,
      there is a 16-megapixel front camera. The Note 12 Pro+ 5G runs on the
      Android 12-based MIUI 13, which is a bummer considering rivals are
      shipping with Android 13.The phone features a MediaTek Dimensity 1080 SoC.
      It has up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage on offer. Another
      HyperCharge feature that the premium Note gets is 120W fast charging
      support for the 5000mAh battery.
