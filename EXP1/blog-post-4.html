    <h1>Motorola Razr 40 Ultra</h1>
    <p>This is a detailed review of the Motorola Razr 40 Ultra.</p>
    <p>
      The Razr 40 Ultra is a premium foldable from Motorola that has a design
      made from metal and glass which compliments its premium price tag. Its
      radical design starts from its cover display which runs from edge to edge
      and also features a high screen refresh rate. This cover display also has
      two embedded main cameras and an LED flash. The inner display of the
      foldable variety. It uses ultra-thin glass and a new hinge to keep its
      crease at a minimum. Software performance is quite fluid with no extra
      bloatware and third party apps. Motorola has also done a fantastic job of
      optimising its MyUX software for its cover display, letting it run full
      apps on the out screen. Camera performance is quite good for a foldable.
      Battery life is average for a foldable smartphone at this price point, but
      wireless charging is a bit too slow.
