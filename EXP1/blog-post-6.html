    <h1>Samsung Galaxy S23</h1>
    <p>This is a detailed review of the Samsung Galaxy S23.</p>
    <p>
      The Galaxy S23 is a compact premium flagship smartphone from Samsung. The
      phone offers a design that is very similar to its predecessor and is made
      of glass and metal. While little has changed in terms of design, its
      compact form factor makes for easy one-handed usage. The phone has a
      6.1-inch Super AMOLED display with a flat screen. Powering the smartphone
      is a customised Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor which offers more
      than enough power for day to day tasks and even gaming. Camera performance
      is quite good and is something one would expect from a premium flagship.
      The same can be said about the phoneâ€™s video recording quality. The phone
      is also capable of capturing 8K video at 30fps. Battery life is impressive
      for a compact device and the phone easily manages a full day of use on a
      single charge. However, wired charging is quite slow for a premium
      smartphone.
