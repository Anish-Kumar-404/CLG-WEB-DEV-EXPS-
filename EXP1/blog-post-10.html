    <h1>Google Pixel 7 Pro</h1>
    <p>This is a detailed review of the Google Pixel 7 Pro.</p>
    <p>
      The Google Pixel 7 Pro gets the premium treatment with a sharper curved
      edge display, more cameras and bigger battery. The Pixel 7 Pro looks
      premium compared to the matte-finished Pixel 7 even though the two
      smartphones share the same core hardware. Inside you will find Google’s
      Tensor G2 processor which in India is available with 12GB of RAM. There’s
      a different ultra-wide-angle camera which now also doubles up as the macro
      camera because it features autofocus. The Pixel 7 Pro also packs in
      telephoto capability offering up to 5X optical zoom and 30X digital zoom.
      Software performance is top notch and Pixel 7 Pro comes with no bloatware
      whilst delivering the fluid Pixel Android experience. Camera performance
      is top notch and so is the macro mode which is a first for Google Pixel
      lineup. Battery performance is not the best as it only lasts a day on a
      single charge. Charging speeds too are relatively slow compared to the
      competition.
