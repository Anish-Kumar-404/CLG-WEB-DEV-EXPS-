      5 The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 offers a large cover display which the brand
      calls ‘Flex Window’. The cover display is the phone’s highlight feature
      along with its new processor and revamped hinge, which also makes it
      appear slimmer than the previous model when folded. Both the outer and
      inner display have excellent sunlight legibility. The main folding display
      also supports HDR10+ content. The new processor offers better performance
      be it software or gaming. However, the device does tend to heat up under
      load, especially when using the camera. Battery life is a bit average and
      charging is a bit too low compared to the competition. Camera performance
      is quite good overall. The phone also performs relatively well when it
      comes to low light performance. While the phone offers a primary and
      ultra-wide angle camera, it lacks a macro camera or capability. Best

      its first Reno branded smartphone to make it into the premium segment. The
      device has a premium design with a polycarbonate frame sandwiched between
      two sheets of 3D curved glass screens. Despite its premium price, the
      phone lacks some premium features like an IP rating and wireless charging.
      Performance with its slightly outdated processor is still quite good and
      will be sufficient for most premium smartphone users. Gaming performance
      with the curved edge OLED display’s 240Hz touch sampling rate is also very
      impressive. Camera performance is quite good. While the primary camera
      performs as expected, the ultra-wide isn’t best in class. The
      high-resolution telephoto camera does an impressive job while shooting at
      its native 3X optical zoom, which is useful for portraits and close-ups.
      Battery life easily lasts over a day with heavy usage and the included
      100W charger is rather quick when it comes to charging the phone.
