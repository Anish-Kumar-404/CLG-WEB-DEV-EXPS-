    <h1>OnePlus 11R</h1>
    <p>This is a detailed review of the OnePlus 11R.</p>
    <p>
      The OnePlus 11R 5G offers users a flagship-grade processor, the same
      primary camera as the 11 5G, and very quick charging — all at a starting
      price of Rs. 39,999. The OnePlus 11R 5G has a 6.74-inch display with the
      same curved edges on the left and right as the 11 5G, but with slightly
      narrower top and bottom bezels. The OnePlus 11R 5G is powered by the very
      capable Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 SoC. This processor probably won't
      deliver the same benchmark numbers as the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, but
      is still plenty powerful for most practical use cases. The OnePlus 11R 5G
      will appeal to many OnePlus fans who have been waiting for something
      similar to the OnePlus 7T to come along — a phone with a proper flagship
      SoC under Rs. 40,000. If you're someone who plays a lot of demanding
      mobile games and require good battery life, the 11R 5G does not
      disappoint. The main camera is also very capable, although the rest of
      them leave a lot to be desired. I think what many are going to like though
      is the fact that the 11R 5G looks just like the more expensive 11 5G,
      giving it more flaunt value.
