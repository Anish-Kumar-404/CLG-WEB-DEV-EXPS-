    <h1>Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra</h1>
    <p>This is a detailed review of the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra.</p>
    <p>
      The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is the most premium device in Samsung’s S23
      lineup. Its design, while premium and still unique, has not changed by
      much, but Samsung has made use of sustainable materials in its
      construction. The display is still the best you can get on an Android
      smartphone in India and offers the same high screen refresh rate as last
      year’s model, but its touch sampling rate fell short of our gaming
      expectations. A highlight of the Galaxy S23 Ultra is its unique processor
      which Samsung has customised to its own requirements. Software operation
      is buttery smooth but there are tons of bloatware both from Samsung and
      third-party apps, that can thankfully be uninstalled. Camera performance
      is better than last year’s Ultra and this is mainly down to the new sensor
      of the primary camera. Zoom performance has also improved and so has video
      recording which can now record proper 8K footage at 30fps. Battery life is
      solid but charging is relatively slow
