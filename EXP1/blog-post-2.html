    <h1>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5</h1>
    <p>This is a detailed review of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5.</p>
    <p>
      The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 offers a large cover display which the brand
      calls ‘Flex Window’. The cover display is the phone’s highlight feature
      along with its new processor and revamped hinge, which also makes it
      appear slimmer than the previous model when folded. Both the outer and
      inner display have excellent sunlight legibility. The main folding display
      also supports HDR10+ content. The new processor offers better performance
      be it software or gaming. However, the device does tend to heat up under
      load, especially when using the camera. Battery life is a bit average and
      charging is a bit too low compared to the competition. Camera performance
      is quite good overall. The phone also performs relatively well when it
      comes to low light performance. While the phone offers a primary and
      ultra-wide angle camera, it lacks a macro camera or capability.
